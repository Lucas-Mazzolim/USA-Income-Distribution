In this work, we conducted a complete Data Intelligence process, where we extracted, cleaned, analyzed, and prepared data for visualization. Our objective is to represent 
the distribution of American income and how it differs depending on factors such as gender, educational level, and work class. We extracted the data from a dataset provided 
by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a renowned American institute. We then used Excel to clean and analyze the data, and finally, created a visualization in Looker Studio, 
Google's BI tool.

Two versions of the project were created, one for each language: Portuguese and English. Each version includes the same components, translated into their respective languages:
the original dataset, the cleaned data along with the analysis conducted in Excel, the visualization created using Google Looker Studio, and, finally, the article explaining
the work.
